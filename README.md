AirTeams API
============

The AirTeams API is implemented as vanilla JSON over HTTP using all four verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE). Every resource, like Event, File, or Application, has their own URL and are manipulated in isolation. In other words, we've tried to make the API follow the REST principles as much as we can.
